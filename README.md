##### Ship AI-Ready APIs 10x Faster with Zero Integration Headaches
Eliminate API integration headaches with Specmatic's no-code AI-powered API development suite. Teams ship APIs 10x faster by transforming specifications into executable contracts instantly‚Äîno coding required, no integration surprises.

### Context

In a complex, interdependent ecosystem, where each service is evolving rapidly, we want to make the dependencies between them explicit in the form of executable contracts. [Contract Driven Development](https://specmatic.io/contract_driven_development.html) leverages API specifications like [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/#openapi-specification), [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) SDL files, [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) Proto files, etc. as executable contracts allowing teams to get instantaneous feedback while making changes to avoid accidental breakage.

With this ability, we can now independently deploy, at will, any service at any time without having to depend on expensive and fragile integration tests.
